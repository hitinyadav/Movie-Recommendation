# Web Development
I have used Streamlit for the web development part, streamlit is easy to use and have some awesome features for the people who dont know much about web development.


# Files
1) App.py is the main application file it contain all code for web development using streamlit. It is our main source file.
2) Movie Recommender System - Content Based.ipynb is a jupyter notebook file which shows how I have read the dataset and transformed raw data, cleaned it for the visualization and prepared our dataframe for further analysis use.
3) tmdb_5000_movies -.zip its a zip file conains dataset I have used in this project.


# Application
1) Our website shows a selectbox, where you cna enter the name of your favourite movie or can select from the dropdown.
2) Once you select the movie hit Recommend.
3) Our algorithm will work on backend and fetch all the similar movies and once its ready it will show you the list of 5 movies which are recommendation considering your choice.
4) Like if you choose Spider-Man 3 in the selectbox then recommendations are Spider-Man 2, The Amazing Spider-Man, etc.
